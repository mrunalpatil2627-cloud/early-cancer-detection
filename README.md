 Cancer Detection & Awareness Hub
A privacy-focused, stateless web application designed to facilitate early-stage cancer awareness and provide a bridge between initial symptom observation and professional medical consultation.

 Problem Statement
Late-Stage Diagnosis: Over 50% of cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages (III or IV), significantly reducing survival rates. Many individuals delay seeking help due to anxiety, lack of awareness, or the complexity of existing medical information.

 The Solution
Our platform provides a low-barrier, non-clinical entry point for users to assess their symptoms. By offering a structured, body-region-specific assessment, we transform vague health concerns into actionable data that users can take to their doctor.

Key Features
Awareness Hub: An educational repository of cancer types and early warning signs.

Quick 7-Question Check: A rapid-fire probability assessment for a fast overview of health risks.

Interactive Body-Region Mapping: A specialized UI allowing users to pinpoint symptoms on specific parts of the body for a targeted evaluation.

On-Screen Clinical Summary: A generated, structured report of the assessment results (Privacy-focused: no data is stored).

Direct Path to Care: Integrated footer with Doctor Contact Information to encourage immediate professional follow-up.

 Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Animations: AOS (Animate On Scroll) Library for a professional, comforting UI.

Architecture: Stateless & Privacy-First. No backend database is used; all logic is processed locally in the browser to ensure 100% user data privacy.

 Future Scope
PWA Support: Enable offline access for users in low-connectivity areas.

Multilingual Interface: Support for regional languages to reach a broader demographic.

AI Integration: Implementing lightweight ML models for more nuanced symptom analysis.
